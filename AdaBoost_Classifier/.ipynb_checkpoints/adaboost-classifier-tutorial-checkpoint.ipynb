    "- **GBM or Gradient Boosting** also works on sequential model. Gradient boosting calculates the gradient (derivative) of the Loss Function with respect to the prediction (instead of the features).

The final prediction is a weighted average of all the weak learners, where more weight is placed on stronger learners.\n",

The main difference therefore is that Gradient Boosting is a generic algorithm to find approximate solutions to the additive modeling problem, while AdaBoost can be seen as a special case with a particular loss function (Exponential loss function). Hence, gradient boosting is much more flexible.\n",
